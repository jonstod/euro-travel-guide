### About EuroGuide
EuroGuide is a web application I developed for travelers and anyone interested in learning more about any specific European countries. On each country's page, you can find a general overview of the country scraped from Wikipedia, content links to each of the top 10 posts of all time on a country's popular subreddit, and the currency exchange rate provided by the US Federal Reserve website.
